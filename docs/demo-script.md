# DentalLeadGenius Demo Script

## Sales Demo Guide for Dental Clinic Owners

---

## FULL SCRIPT (15-Minute Demo)

### Phase 1: Opening Rapport (2 minutes)

**Opening:**
> "Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time today! Before we dive in, I'd love to learn a bit about your practice. How long have you been running [Clinic Name]?"

**Build Connection:**
> "That's great! And what made you interested in looking at a solution like DentalLeadGenius?"

*Listen actively. Note their specific pain points.*

---

### Phase 2: Pain Discovery Questions (3 minutes)

Ask these questions to uncover their core problems:

1. **Lead Volume:** "How many new patient inquiries do you typically get per week?"

2. **Response Time:** "When someone calls or fills out a form, how quickly does your team usually respond?"

3. **Missed Opportunities:** "What happens to leads that come in after hours or when your front desk is busy?"

4. **Follow-Up System:** "Do you have a system for following up with people who didn't book on the first contact?"

5. **Revenue Impact:** "If I told you that the average missed lead is worth $3,000-$5,000 in lifetime value, does that resonate with your experience?"

*Take notes on specific numbers they share - use these in your ROI demonstration.*

---

### Phase 3: ROI Demonstration (5 minutes)

**Transition:**
> "Based on what you've shared, let me show you exactly how DentalLeadGenius would work for [Clinic Name]..."

**Key Points to Cover:**

1. **Instant Response AI:**
   > "See this? The moment a patient reaches out - website, Facebook, missed call - our AI responds in under 30 seconds. 24/7. No more lost leads."

2. **Automated Follow-Up:**
   > "Here's where the magic happens. If someone doesn't book, our system automatically follows up on Day 1, Day 3, and Day 5 with personalized messages. Most clinics see 3-10x more bookings just from this."

3. **Dashboard & Analytics:**
   > "And here's your dashboard. At a glance, you can see exactly how many leads came in, how many booked, and your conversion rate. No more guessing."

**Calculate Their ROI:**
> "You mentioned you get about [X] leads per week. If we help you convert just 2-3 more per month, at an average case value of $3,000... that's $6,000-$9,000 in additional monthly revenue. Our system pays for itself in the first week."

### Phase 4: Screenshare Flow (3 minutes)

1. **Lead Dashboard** - Show the lead list and status tracking
2. **AI Chatbot Demo** - Show a live conversation example

### Phase 5: Objection Handling (1-2 minutes)

See objection handles below.

---

### Phase 6: Close (2 minutes)

**Strong Close:**
> "So here's what I'd recommend: Let's get your clinic set up this week. We'll have everything configured within 48 hours, and you'll start seeing new leads come in immediately."

> "We don't do long-term contracts - you can cancel anytime. But honestly, once you see the results, you won't want to."

> "Should we set up your onboarding call for tomorrow or Thursday?"

**Calendar Close:**
> "I have availability [time A] or [time B] - which works better for your schedule?"

---

## SHORT SCRIPT (5 minutes)

1. **Open:** "Thanks for joining! Tell me - what's your biggest frustration with getting new patients right now?"

3. **Solution:** "Here's exactly how we fix that..." [Show 2-minute demo]

4. **ROI:** "Clients typically see [X] more bookings per month. At your average case value, that's [Y] in additional revenue."

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "It's too expensive"

> "I totally understand budget is a concern. Let me ask you this - how much is a single new patient worth to your practice?"

*Wait for answer*

> "Right, so at [$3,000+], if DentalLeadGenius brings you just ONE extra patient per month, it's already paid for itself several times over. Most clients see 5-10 extra bookings monthly."

> "Would it help if I showed you the ROI calculator for your specific situation?"

---

### "We already use software"

> "That's great that you're already investing in technology! What solution are you using?"

*Listen*

> "Got it. The difference with DentalLeadGenius is that we're specifically built for dental clinics. We don't just collect leads - we actively convert them with AI that responds instantly and follows up automatically."

> "Many of our clients switched from [competitor] and saw their conversion rates double within 30 days. Would you be open to a side-by-side comparison?"

---

### "We're too busy right now"

> "I completely understand - running a dental practice is demanding. Here's the thing though: being busy is exactly why you need this."

> "Our whole purpose is to save your team 15+ hours per week on repetitive follow-ups. And once set up, it runs on autopilot. We handle everything during the 48-hour onboarding - you just answer a few questions."

> "What if we scheduled the setup for a slower day this week?"

---

### "Send me info first"

> "Absolutely, I can send you our overview. But honestly, the best way to see if this is right for your practice is this quick 15-minute demo."

> "I can show you exactly how the AI would work for [Clinic Name] specifically. Plus, you'll get to ask any questions. Does [time] work for a quick walkthrough?"

*If they insist:*

> "No problem. I'll send that over now. When would be a good time for me to follow up and answer any questions?"

---

### "I need to think about it"

> "Of course, this is an important decision. What specifically would you like to think through?"

*Address the specific concern*

> "The good news is there's no long-term commitment. You can try it risk-free and cancel anytime if it's not the right fit."

> "What would need to happen for you to feel confident moving forward today?"

---

### "Let me talk to my partner/team"

> "That makes total sense - important decisions should involve the whole team. Would it be helpful if I scheduled a brief 10-minute call with your partner too?"

> "That way they can ask any questions directly, and you won't have to relay all the technical details."

> "What day works best for all of you?"
