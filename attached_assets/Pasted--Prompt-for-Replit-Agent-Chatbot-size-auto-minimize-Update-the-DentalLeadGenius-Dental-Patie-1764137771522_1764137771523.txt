Prompt for Replit Agent (Chatbot size + auto-minimize):

Update the DentalLeadGenius / Dental Patient AI chatbot widget behavior and styling:

1. Chatbot size & position

Place the chatbot in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

Default expanded size (when open):

Desktop: max-width around 380px, max-height around 60–65% of viewport height.

Mobile: width 100% of screen, height around 55–60% of viewport height, anchored to the bottom (so user can still see page behind).


Add enough margin from the edges so it doesn’t hide important buttons.



2. Auto-open then auto-minimize

On first page load:

Wait 10 seconds, then auto-open the chatbot once.

Show a friendly greeting message as it opens.


After it has been open for about 10 seconds, automatically minimize it to a small chat bubble in the bottom-right corner.

When minimized, only a small round/square bubble with the assistant avatar + short label like “Chat with us” should be visible, so the user can freely read the website.



3. User control

User can click the bubble to open the full chat window any time.

In the open state, show a clear close / minimize icon (X or ˅) that minimizes back to the small bubble.

Once the user manually closes/minimizes the chat, do not auto-open again on that visit (use a simple flag in localStorage or a React state).



4. Do NOT block the page

Make sure the chatbot never covers the whole page or prevents scrolling the main content.

Dentist testimonials, text and other sections must remain readable behind/around the chat.

Check both desktop and mobile preview to guarantee that the user can scroll and interact with the website while the chatbot is open or minimized.



5. Code notes

Centralize the widget logic in the existing ChatbotWidget (or equivalent) component.

Implement the 10s timers with setTimeout (cleaned up on unmount).

Make sure styles are in Tailwind or the project’s existing CSS system.

After changes, run the app and verify:

Auto-open after 10s

Auto-minimize after 10s

Bubble re-opens on click

Close/minimize buttons work

Layout looks good on mobile and desktop.





Please implement these changes now and update any related files (components, CSS) so the chatbot behaves exactly as described.
