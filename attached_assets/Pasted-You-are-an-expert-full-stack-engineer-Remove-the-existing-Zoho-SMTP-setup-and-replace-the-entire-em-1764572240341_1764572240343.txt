Remove the existing Zoho SMTP setup and replace the entire email system with Resend API.


---

GOAL

Convert our DentalLeadGenius project to Resend-based email sending, using only the Resend API and the RESEND_API_KEY stored in Replit Secrets.


---

REQUIREMENTS

1. Completely remove Zoho integration

Remove Zoho SMTP code.

Remove SMTP utils.

Remove all Zoho-based env variables.

Remove any SMTP or Nodemailer config that points to smtp.zoho.com.

Clean up /utils/email.js or replace it entirely.


2. Install Resend package

If using Node.js:

npm install resend

3. Create a new unified email utility

Create a new file:

/backend/utils/email.js

With a function:

const { Resend } = require("resend");
const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

async function sendEmail({ to, subject, html }) {
  try {
    await resend.emails.send({
      from: "DentalLeadGenius <notifications@dentalleadgenius.com>",
      to,
      subject,
      html
    });
    return { ok: true };
  } catch (error) {
    return { ok: false, error: error.message };
  }
}

module.exports = { sendEmail };

4. Update backend routes

Update /api/demo-request to use sendEmail() for:

1. Notification → support@dentalleadgenius.com


2. Auto-reply email → req.body.email



Return:


{ ok: true }

on success.

5. Update health check route

Update /health/email to send a test email to:

support@dentalleadgenius.com

using the new Resend utility.

Return JSON:

{ ok: true } if email sent

{ ok: false, error } if failed


6. Frontend Integration (React)

Make no major UI layout changes, but ensure:

Demo form POSTs to /api/demo-request

On success → clear form

Show success message: “Thank you! Your demo request is received. Our team will contact you soon.”


7. Use ENV variable only

Resend must use:

process.env.RESEND_API_KEY

No hardcoding allowed.

8. Show full diff summary

After implementation:

Show list of new files created

Show which files were modified

Show old SMTP code that was removed

Show new Resend-based email code



---

IMPORTANT

The domain “dentalleadgenius.com” is already added to Resend.
Do NOT create or verify anything new.
Just integrate Resend into backend email logic.


---

🌟 Final instruction:

Scan entire project → remove Zoho → install Resend → create new email utility → update backend → test → show diff.
