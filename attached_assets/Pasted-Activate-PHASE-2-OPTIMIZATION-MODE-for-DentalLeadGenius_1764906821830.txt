====================================================
     PART 1 — ADVANCED LEAD OPTIMIZATION ENGINE
====================================================
Enable the following:

✔ Prioritize these clinic types:
   - Large clinics
   - Multi-location dental groups
   - Cosmetic dentists

   - Review count
   - Review rating
   - Social presence
   - Technology adoption likelihood

✔ Send HIGH SCORE leads first.

✔ Store every lead with:
   - Lead score
   - Sent emails count
   - Open behavior
   - Click behavior
   - Reply behavior

====================================================
     PART 2 — SEND-TIME AI OPTIMIZATION
====================================================
Add intelligent sending logic:

✔ Track when leads open emails  
✔ Cluster by timezone + open-pattern  
✔ Auto-adjust sending time per group  
✔ Spread out sending over 3 time windows:
   - 8:00 AM
   - 11:30 AM
   - 4:00 PM

✔ Auto-randomize within ±15 minutes to avoid spam filters.

====================================================
     PART 3 — DELIVERY BOOST ENGINE
====================================================
Activate deliverability strategies:

✔ 7 template variations per email day  
✔ Rotate subject lines  
✔ Insert random micro-variations (but keep meaning same)  
✔ Avoid spam words  
✔ Lower image-to-text ratio (text-heavy emails perform best)  
✔ Auto-throttle if bounce rate > 4%  
✔ Auto-switch sending domain if complaint rate > 0.2%  
✔ Add warm-up cycle for new domains  

====================================================
     PART 4 — AI RESPONSE HANDLING ENGINE
====================================================
Whenever a dentist replies:

✔ If they ask for info → auto-send “Information Follow-Up Email”
✔ If they ask for price → auto-send “Pricing + 30-Day Offer Email”
✔ If they say “not interested” → reply politely + delay next contact by 60 days
✔ If reply is positive → auto-book demo link reply
✔ If they request a call → send calendar link

====================================================
     PART 5 — DEMO AUTO-BOOKING SYSTEM
====================================================
When a dentist shows buying signals:

✔ 2+ opens  
✔ 1+ link click  
✔ positive reply  
✔ viewed pricing  

AUTO-SEND:

“Direct Demo Invite Email”  
with your demo link:
https://DentalLeadGenius.com/demo

If they don’t book within 4 hours → send gentle reminder.

====================================================
     PART 6 — HOT LEADS TRACKING ENGINE
====================================================
Mark lead as HOT if:

HOT leads get:

✔ Faster follow-ups

====================================================
Mark as DEAD if:

Dead leads get paused for 90 days.
