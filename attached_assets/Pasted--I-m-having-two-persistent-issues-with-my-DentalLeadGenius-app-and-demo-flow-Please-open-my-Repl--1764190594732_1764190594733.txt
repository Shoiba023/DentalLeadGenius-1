> I’m having two persistent issues with my DentalLeadGenius app and demo flow. Please open my Repl and fix them end-to-end.

Repl / App
– Name: DentalLeadGenius (Dental lead generation SaaS)
– Public URL: https://dental-lead-genius-1-shoibaali10.replit.app/


---

1) “Service Unavailable” / blank black screen

Sometimes, when I open the public URL on my phone, I only see a black screen with a tiny “Service Unavailable” message in the top-left corner.

What I need you to do

1. Check the deployed logs and server start-up logs to see why the production deployment is returning Service Unavailable.


2. Fix any crash, port, or environment issues so that the root URL (/) always loads the main marketing page instead of a black screen.


3. Make sure the app is built and deployed correctly, and that any required migrations or build steps run before starting the server.


4. After fixing it, test the deployed URL from the browser inside Replit (mobile view if possible) and confirm that:

the page loads successfully,

there is no Service Unavailable message,

refreshing multiple times still works.

2) Demo / Start Free Trial → 404 router error

On the homepage, there are buttons like “Start Free Trial” / “Free Trial” / demo links.

Right now:

The first main link sometimes works.

The second Free Trial / demo link still sends users to a URL that returns this error: “404 Page Not Found – Did you forget to add the page to the router?”


I want these buttons to open the interactive demo page (the one that shows “Explore DentalLeadGenius” with the tabs: Overview, Leads, Outreach, AI Chatbot, Multi-Clinic) – not a 404 page.

What I need you to do

1. Find the route/component for that interactive demo page (for example /demo, /live-demo, or another path).


2. Check the React/Next router configuration and ensure that:

the public demo route is registered correctly,

it works in production build, not just dev.



3. Update all demo / Free Trial / Start Free Trial buttons on the site so they navigate to that correct demo route.


4. Re-deploy the app, then click every demo / free-trial link yourself on the deployed site and confirm:

no link produces a 404,

every link opens the same working interactive demo page.

3) Demo form behaviour

On the demo page I want the following behaviour:

1. The user can enter any email address (it does NOT have to be a clinic domain email).


2. When the user submits the demo request form:

They should be immediately redirected to the interactive demo inside the browser (no waiting for manual scheduling).

An email with the demo link can still be sent in the background, but please don’t block the redirect on that.



3. If there is any email-domain validation that only allows “clinic” emails, please remove or relax it so that any normal email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) is accepted.



Please show me in your summary:

which route is now the public demo URL,

where you wired the buttons,

and how the demo form → redirect → email flow now works.


Thank you. Please do not change the marketing copy or chatbot content; just fix stability, routing, and the demo access flow.
