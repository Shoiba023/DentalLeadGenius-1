You are a senior frontend + Stripe integration engineer working in this exact Replit project.

CRITICAL PRODUCTION BUG (EXACT ISSUE):

The pricing UI visuals are correct, BUT the Stripe checkout is REVERSED on the live Render site.

Production URL (where the bug happens):
https://dentalleadgenius-1.onrender.com

CURRENT BEHAVIOR (WRONG):
- Clicking "Monthly Subscription ($1,497/month)" opens Stripe checkout for $4,997 one-time ❌
- Clicking "One-Time Setup Fee ($4,997)" opens Stripe checkout for $1,497/month ❌

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (MUST FIX):
- Monthly button → Stripe monthly price ($1,497/month)
- One-time button → Stripe one-time setup ($4,997 one-time)

THIS IS NOT A STRIPE DASHBOARD ISSUE.
THIS IS A FRONTEND → STRIPE LINK / PRICE ID MAPPING BUG.

YOUR TASKS (FOLLOW STRICTLY):

1. LOCATE STRIPE INTEGRATION
- Find where Stripe checkout URLs or price IDs are defined in this codebase.
- Identify the variables for:
  - Monthly subscription price / link
  - One-time setup price / link

2. FIX THE MAPPING
- Ensure the "Monthly Subscription ($1,497/month)" button uses ONLY the monthly Price ID / URL.
- Ensure the "One-Time Setup Fee ($4,997)" button uses ONLY the one-time setup Price ID / URL.
- Do NOT rely on array index order or toggles that can flip accidentally.
- Use explicit constants, for example:
  - STRIPE_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID (for $1,497/month)
  - STRIPE_SETUP_PRICE_ID (for $4,997 one-time)
- Make sure there is no situation where the two get swapped again.

3. VERIFY LOCALLY IN REPLIT
- Run the app in Replit.
- Click the Monthly button and confirm Stripe shows $1,497/month.
- Click the One-time button and confirm Stripe shows $4,997 one-time.
- Test multiple times and toggles to confirm the mapping NEVER reverses.

4. DO NOT CHANGE:
- UI design
- Prices ($1,497 and $4,997)
- Copy/text
- Stripe dashboard settings or products/prices in Stripe itself

5. PREPARE FOR RENDER (GIT MANDATORY)
- After fixing the bug, you MUST:
  - Stage all relevant files.
  - Commit with this message exactly:
    "Fix Stripe checkout mapping (monthly vs one-time reversed)"
  - Push to GitHub (origin/main), so Render can deploy the latest commit.
- If Replit security blocks git commands, PRINT for me the exact shell commands I should run in the Shell tab to:
  - Stage all files
  - Commit with the message above
  - Push to origin/main

6. FINAL CONFIRMATION (REPORT AT THE END)
When you are done, you MUST clearly report:
- Which file(s) you changed (with paths).
- How the Stripe mapping now works (which button → which Stripe price).
- That the code is committed and pushed to GitHub and is ready for deployment on Render.
- Confirm that after deploy, the bug on:
  https://dentalleadgenius-1.onrender.com
will be fixed (Monthly → $1,497/month, One-time → $4,997 one-time).

Do NOT stop after “local fix only”.
The goal is: FIX THE MAPPING + PUSH CLEAN CODE TO GITHUB so I can redeploy on Render with correct Stripe behavior.
